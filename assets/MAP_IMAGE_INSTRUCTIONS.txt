SUMMONER'S RIFT MAP IMAGE NEEDED
=====================================

You need to add a Summoner's Rift map image to this folder.

Filename: summoners_rift.png

Where to get it:
1. Search Google Images for "summoners rift map" or "league of legends map"
2. Download a high-quality PNG image (recommended: 1920x1080 or higher)
3. Save it as "summoners_rift.png" in this assets/ folder

Alternative:
- You can use any background image you prefer
- If you want a different image, update the SUMMONERS_RIFT_IMAGE path in config.py

Note: The current image_generator.py creates a simple colored background instead of 
using the map image. You can enhance it to actually use the map as a background if desired.
